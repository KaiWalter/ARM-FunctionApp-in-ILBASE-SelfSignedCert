# ARM-FunctionApp-in-ILBASE-SelfSignedCert
ARM templates that creates a Function App in an ILB ASE with self-signed certificate. These templates are based on [Create App Service Environment with an ILB Address, by Stefan Schackow](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/201-web-app-ase-ilb-create/). 

What I try to achieve: get a Function App working in an ILB ASE - including the Functions Portal experience

STATUS: work in progress, when opening the Function App still errors appear that the portal is not able to access the keys
